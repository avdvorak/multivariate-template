## ANTs Installation
The pipeline used the Advanced Normalization Tools software (https://github.com/ANTsX/ANTs). Instructions for compiling and setting up ANTs can be found here:

https://github.com/ANTsX/ANTs/wiki/Compiling-ANTs-on-Linux-and-Mac-OS


## FSL Installation
The script also uses some generic functions from FSL, which can be called after installation of FSL, as detailed here:

https://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslwiki/FslInstallation

or can be replaced with an ANTs equivalent (usually via the *ImageMath* command).


## SCT Installation
The script also uses the Spinal Cord Toolbox (SCT) software. Installation instructions are available here:
